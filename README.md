<h1 align="center"> Containerization <h1>
* Containerization is a form of virtualization. Virtualization aims to run multiple OS instances on a single server, whereas containerization runs a single OS instance, with multiple user spaces to isolate processes from one another. This means containerization makes sense for one AWS cloud user that plans to run multiple processes simultaneously. 
* Containerization is achieved by packaging software code, libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies together in an isolated user space called a container. This container is portable and can be used on any infrastructure in any environment that supports the container technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes.
